    <p>Who doesn’t know Malgudi, the small, sleepy and fictional town in South India which has long made its imprint on every Indian heart?</p><br>
    <p>Thanks to the widely popular Indian television series by the same name, Malgudi is one of the most recognized fictional elements in <b>Indian writing.</b></p><br>
    <p>The town with its many occupants has given us innumerable stories to delve on.</p><br>
    <p>But, Rasipuram Krishnaswami Iyer Narayanaswami more popularly known as R.K. Narayan, the creative genius who gave us Malgudi Days, is not just known for Malgudi Days but also for countless other beautiful books such as Bachelor of Arts, Swami and Friends, Guide, The Man-Eater of Malgudi, The Dark Room, The English Teacher, Waiting for the Mahatma, A Tiger for Malgudi and The World of Nagaraj among others.</p><br>
    <p><b>My Days: A Memoir </b> is the master storyteller’s memoir describing the intricacies of his life with fervour and with the best of his witticism and candidness.</p><br>
    <p>Narayan beautifully outlines his childhood life at Madras, his initial college years at Mysore, a brief stint as a college teacher and in vivid details describes his journey as an author.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Narayan as a child used to live with his grandmother and maternal uncle at their house in Madras. This was an arrangement which had been in place since his toddler days and continued right until the end of his school years.</p>
    <br>
    <p>His father, mother along with his other siblings used to live in a sleepy town in Karnataka (before finally moving to Mysore), where his father served as the school headmaster.</p><br>
    <p>There are few authors who will forever be etched in my memories, and heart and needless to say R.K. Narayan is one of them. Thus, <b>My Days: A Memoir </b> is worth reading for anyone who is interested in Indian literature.</p><br>
